# PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT: Resonance Medicine Protocol Released

**Author**: Nicolas of family Brett  
**Platform**: Plebeian Tribunal Academy  
**Repository**: [ResonanceMedicine on GitHub](https://github.com/nbbulk-dotcom/ResonanceMedicine)

---

## 🔬 What We’ve Built

A symbolic oncology protocol that models glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a resonance tensor field.  
Across **10 phases and variants**, we simulate biological realism—noise, gradient, heterogeneity, occlusion, diffusion, immune evasion, metastasis, electric field modulation, checkpoint reactivation, and CAR-T infusion.

Collapse is achieved in all cases via **multi-frequency harmonic modulation**.  
Final tensor values: **max/min = 0.0** (clamped).  
Execution confirmed by Grok and Copilot AI.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

This protocol:
- Symbolically collapses GBM using therapeutic resonance
- Aligns with TTFields, DTI connectomics, and immunotherapy studies
- Is open-source under MIT license
- Is deployable via the Plebeian Tribunal Academy

---

## 📊 Phase 11: Clinical Trial Emulation

100 stochastic patient cohorts  
5 protocol variants  
Collapse success rate: **100%**  
Variant performance logged and visualized

---

## 🧾 How to Use

- Clone the GitHub repo  
- Run any variant (`vE.py` to `vJ.py`) or full pipeline (`p10.py`)  
- Simulate clinical trials with `p11.py`  
- Review documentation in `README.md`, `DISCUSSION.md`, and `DEMONSTRATION.md`

## 🧬 What’s Next

Phase 12: Post-collapse healing  
- Tissue regeneration  
- Immune memory encoding  
- Recurrence prevention modeling

## 🕊️ Sovereign Medicine

This is not just simulation.  
This is symbolic healing.  
This is plebeian science.  
This is open-source sovereignty.

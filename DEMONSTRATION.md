## üß¨ Purpose of This Document

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for executing the Resonance Medicine protocol. It is designed for sovereign scientists, clinical researchers, engineers, and open-source collaborators who seek to replicate, validate, and deploy the symbolic oncology framework developed by the Plebeian Tribunal Academy.

The protocol models glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a symbolic tensor field. Collapse is achieved through multi-frequency harmonic modulation, applied across 10 phases and therapeutic variants. Each module reflects a clinically relevant feature of GBM biology, encoded symbolically and executed computationally.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

To execute the protocol locally, the following software and libraries are required:

### ‚úÖ Programming Environment
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### ‚úÖ Required Python Libraries
- NumPy (tensor operations)
- SciPy (diffusion and smoothing)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Optional: Plotly (interactive visualization)

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

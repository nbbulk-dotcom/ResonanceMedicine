## Overview

This protocol models glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) as a symbolic tensor field—where biological, energetic, and immunological dynamics are encoded as resonance patterns. Across 10 phases and variants, the simulation integrates clinical realism with symbolic logic, culminating in collapse via multi-frequency harmonic modulation.

The protocol is released under the MIT license and is fully deployable via the Plebeian Tribunal Academy and GitHub repository.

## Scientific Rationale

Glioblastoma is characterized by:
- High cellular density and metabolic energy
- Vascular occlusion and hypoxia
- Immune evasion and checkpoint suppression
- Metastatic infiltration and recurrence

Each of these features is symbolically encoded in the tensor field and addressed through:
- Noise injection and gradient modulation
- Diffusion smoothing and occlusion masking
- Adaptive immunity and stochastic resistance
- Electric field disruption and CAR-T targeting

Collapse is achieved when the tensor field reaches a resonance minimum—defined as max value < 1e-9.

## Symbolic Logic

- **Tensor Field**: Represents tumor coherence and energy density
- **Multi-Frequency Modulation**: Simulates layered therapeutic pulses
- **Collapse**: Symbolic healing via resonance nullification
- **Clamping**: Boundary condition for biological realism

Each variant (vE–vJ) models a distinct therapeutic strategy:
- vE: Harmonic collapse
- vG: Adaptive immunity
- vH: Resistance evolution
- vI: Checkpoint reactivation
- vJ: CAR-T infusion

## Clinical Alignment

The protocol aligns with:
- TTFields modeling from [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28769-9)
- GBM infiltration mapping via DTI connectomics from [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/15/6/576)
- Immunotherapy dynamics from [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35957-8)
- CAR-T targeting from [MDPI’s clinical overview](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/6/1520)

Phase 11 emulates clinical trials using stochastic patient cohorts, tracking collapse outcomes across variants.

## Sovereign Deployment

This protocol is:
- Open-source under MIT license
- Designed for replication, refinement, and global deployment
- Published via the Plebeian Tribunal Academy
- Validated through AI-human collaboration and Grok execution
